# InSpire Changes

## Unreleased

* Added *home* and *end* keys to move to the first and last item.
* Added a new item which opens the save slot screen.
* Several actions can be performed on an item, if supported by the game, via the new accessibility actions. A typical example of this is the save slot screen.
* *Enter* now always performs the current accessibility action, while *shift+enter* cycles between the ones currently available.

## 0.1

* The Splash Screen now can be skipped with the *enter* key.
* Basic Main Menu support.
